Welcome to Example Intersphinx Project's documentation!
=======================================================

In this project, we rely in definition of :term:`Example Term`, as provided by Example Standalone Docs.


If we want to be future proof, we can reference :term:`intertest:Example Term` as a namespaced term (see source code).
